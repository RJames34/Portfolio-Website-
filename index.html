    <h2> Hi, Welcome to my portfolio website, I'm Rianna</h2>
    <p> I'm a Computer Science major at Boston University with a passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. After completing a summer course at Cornell on the foundations of machine learning, I became even more interested in how ML and AI are evolving into everyday tools and shaping the future of technology.
        Web development, especially front-end where it combines two things I love: design and coding! I love collaboration, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and internships.
        If youâ€™re ever interested in connecting on these topics, feel free to reach out!</p>
